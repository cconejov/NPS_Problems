## Exercise 2: Compare the MISE and AMISE criteria in three densities in nor1mix of your choice.

## 1. Code (2.33) and the AMISE expression for the normal kernel, and compare the two error curves.

## 2. Compare them for n = 100, 200, 500, adding a vertical line to represent the $h_{MISE}$ and $h_{AMISE}$ bandwidths. Describe in detail the results and the major takeaways.
