## Question 1

Assess S claims of battery failure from temperatures from a sample of previous batteries that experienced failure and from a sample in general 

a. Perform a kernel density estimation for temps-7 and temps-other using what you consider is the most adequate bandwidth. Since the temperatures are positive, is it required to perform any transformation?.

b. Is there any important difference on the results from considering the LSCV selector over the DPI selector?

c. It seems that in temps-7 there is a secondary mode. Compute a kernel derivative estimation for temps-7 and temps-other using what you consider are the 
most adequate bandwidths.

d. Precisely determine the location of the extreme points

e. Check with a kernel second derivative that the extreme points are actually modes.
